# Predicting Rainfall With Machine Learning
 This project created two classifiers, KN and SVC, in order to predict if rainfall will occur. An accuracy of 0.994 was achieved.

# Setup
A fresh version of python 3.12 is required. 

I recommend from here all is done in VSCode.

First open your cmd prompt with control + shift + '

Next, input your python path followed by setup.py. An example of this would be:

<code>python setup.py</code>

Note: the above code assumes you have your python path in your PATH variables. 

Let this run and it will set up all the needed directories, packages, and files.

Once this is done, open the jupyter notebook called 'Analysis.ipynb'

I advise having the jupyter notebook extension installed into your VSCode instance.

Next, hit control + shift + p and type 'Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel'.

Navigate to the .venv that has been made and select this.

Simply hit 'Run All' or go step by step!

This will download and extract the needed data (provided the data is still publicly available), generate all the analytics I conducted and save out the two classification models as pickle file.
